# S3 Bucket Deletion Fix

## Problem
When users tried to delete their accounts, the AWS S3 buckets were not being properly deleted, leaving orphaned buckets in AWS that continued to incur costs.

## Root Causes
The original bucket deletion logic had several issues:

1. **Incomplete Object Deletion**: Only listed objects once, missing pagination for buckets with >1000 objects
2. **Missing Versioned Objects**: Didn't handle object versions and delete markers
3. **Incomplete Multipart Uploads**: Failed to abort incomplete multipart uploads
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Generic error handling that didn't address specific S3 deletion scenarios

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive `deleteS3BucketCompletely()` function that:

### Step 1: Abort Multipart Uploads
```javascript
// Abort all incomplete multipart uploads that prevent bucket deletion
const listMultipartCommand = new ListMultipartUploadsCommand({
  Bucket: bucketName,
  MaxUploads: 1000
});
```

### Step 2: Delete All Object Versions
```javascript
// Handle versioned objects and delete markers with pagination
const listVersionsCommand = new ListObjectVersionsCommand({
  Bucket: bucketName,
  MaxKeys: 1000,
  KeyMarker: continuationToken
});
```

### Step 3: Final Object Cleanup
```javascript
// Ensure no objects remain using ListObjectsV2 with pagination
const listObjectsCommand = new ListObjectsV2Command({
  Bucket: bucketName,
  MaxKeys: 1000,
  ContinuationToken: objectsContinuationToken
});
```

### Step 4: Verification
```javascript
// Verify bucket is completely empty before deletion
const finalCheck = await s3Client.send(new ListObjectsV2Command({ 
  Bucket: bucketName, 
  MaxKeys: 1 
}));
```

### Step 5: Bucket Deletion
```javascript
// Finally delete the empty bucket
await s3Client.send(new DeleteBucketCommand({ Bucket: bucketName }));
```

## Features Added

### 1. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Handles `NoSuchBucket` (already deleted)
- Handles `BucketNotEmpty` (cleanup failed)
- Handles `AccessDenied` (permission issues)
- Provides specific error messages to users

### 2. Detailed Logging
- Step-by-step progress logging
- Object count tracking
- Error details for debugging
- Success confirmation

### 3. Manual Cleanup Utility
Created `server/cleanup-bucket.js` for manual bucket cleanup:

```bash
# Usage
npm run cleanup-bucket <bucket-name>

# Example
npm run cleanup-bucket skycrate-1234567890-abc123
```

### 4. Improved Frontend Error Handling
- Specific error messages based on error type
- Network connectivity checks
- Automatic logout on auth errors
- Success confirmation messages

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Account Deletion
1. Create a test account
2. Upload several files (including large files for multipart uploads)
3. Delete the account
4. Verify in AWS Console that the bucket is completely removed

### 2. Test Manual Cleanup
```bash
# If a bucket gets stuck, use manual cleanup
npm run cleanup-bucket your-bucket-name
```

### 3. Test Error Scenarios
- Test with invalid AWS credentials
- Test with network disconnection
- Test with already-deleted buckets

## Monitoring

### Server Logs
The enhanced logging provides detailed information:
```
🔍 Starting comprehensive S3 bucket cleanup for: skycrate-1234567890-abc123
🧹 Step 1: Aborting incomplete multipart uploads...
🧹 Step 2: Deleting all object versions...
🗑️ Deleting 150 object versions...
✅ Successfully deleted 150 object versions
🧹 Step 3: Final cleanup of any remaining objects...
🔍 Step 4: Verifying bucket is empty...
🪣 Step 5: Deleting the bucket...
🎉 Successfully deleted bucket skycrate-1234567890-abc123 and all its contents
```

### Error Logs
Detailed error information for troubleshooting:
```javascript
console.error('❌ Critical error deleting S3 bucket:', {
  error: err.name,
  message: err.message,
  bucket: bucketName,
  userId: userId
});
```

## Cost Impact
This fix prevents:
- **Orphaned S3 buckets** continuing to incur storage costs
- **Incomplete multipart uploads** consuming storage space
- **Object versions** accumulating over time
- **Manual AWS Console cleanup** requiring developer intervention

## Security Considerations
- Maintains existing AWS IAM permission requirements
- Preserves user data isolation during deletion
- Includes comprehensive error logging for audit trails
- Fails safely if permissions are insufficient

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, the original deletion logic can be restored by:
1. Commenting out the new `deleteS3BucketCompletely()` function
2. Restoring the original inline deletion code
3. Using the manual cleanup utility for any stuck buckets

## Future Improvements
1. **Batch Processing**: For very large buckets (>10,000 objects)
2. **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates to frontend
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient AWS errors
4. **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic cleanup of incomplete uploads

**Result**: Account deletion now properly removes all AWS S3 resources, preventing orphaned buckets and unexpected costs.
