# SkyCrate - Cloud File Storage

A secure cloud file storage application built with React, Node.js, and AWS S3. Users can upload, manage, and share files with automatic S3 bucket creation for each user.

## Features

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage**: Automatic S3 bucket creation for each user
- 📁 **File Management**: Upload, download, delete, and star files
- 🔒 **Private Storage**: Each user gets their own isolated S3 bucket
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Modern UI that works on all devices
- ⚡ **Pre-signed URLs**: Secure file access without public exposure

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, React Icons, React Dropzone
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, JWT, bcryptjs
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3
- **File Upload**: Multer
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern gradients and animations

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- AWS Account with S3 access
- AWS IAM user with S3 permissions

## New contributors setup

To ensure a smooth onboarding experience and consistent Git behavior across platforms:

- Windows users: this repo enforces LF line endings via `.gitattributes`. Configure Git to keep LF on commit:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  ```
  If you cloned the repo before this change and you see line-ending warnings, normalize your working tree once:
  ```bash
  git add --renormalize .
  git commit -m "Normalize line endings to LF"
  ```
- macOS/Linux users: no action needed; LF is the default.

Environment variables are provided in `env.example`. Copy it to `.env` and update the values before running locally.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd skycrate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` file with your AWS credentials:
   ```env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key_here
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the backend server (port 5000) and frontend (port 3000).

## AWS Setup

### Required IAM Permissions

Your AWS user needs the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:DeleteBucket",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls",
                "s3:GetBucketOwnershipControls"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::skycrate-*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::skycrate-*/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They're already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use IAM roles** instead of access keys in production
3. **Enable bucket encryption** for sensitive data
4. **Set up CloudTrail** for audit logging
5. **Use VPC endpoints** for enhanced security
