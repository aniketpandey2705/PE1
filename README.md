# SkyCrate - Cloud File Storage

A secure cloud file storage application built with React, Node.js, and AWS S3 with **intelligent storage class optimization**. Users can upload, manage, and share files with automatic cost optimization.

## üí∞ NEW: AWS S3 Storage Class Selection

**Save up to 96% on AWS S3 costs!** SkyCrate now offers intelligent storage class selection with user choice:

- **Smart recommendations** based on file type and size
- **User choice** - select from all 6 AWS S3 storage classes
- **Real-time cost estimation** for every storage class option
- **Transparent pricing** with savings calculator
- **Cost analysis dashboard** to track your savings

**Available Storage Classes:**
- **STANDARD** ($0.023/GB/month) - Frequent access
- **STANDARD_IA** ($0.0125/GB/month) - 46% savings
- **ONEZONE_IA** ($0.01/GB/month) - 57% savings
- **GLACIER_IR** ($0.004/GB/month) - 83% savings
- **GLACIER** ($0.0036/GB/month) - 84% savings
- **DEEP_ARCHIVE** ($0.00099/GB/month) - 96% savings

**How it works:**
1. Upload a file ‚Üí Storage class modal appears
2. See smart recommendation based on file type
3. Choose from all available storage classes
4. View estimated costs and savings
5. Upload with your selected storage class

See [`AWS_STORAGE_CLASSES.md`](./AWS_STORAGE_CLASSES.md) for detailed information.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone and install:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd skycrate
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup AWS credentials:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` file with your AWS credentials:
   ```env
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key_here
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   
   # Storage Class Selection (NEW)
   SHOW_STORAGE_CLASS_OPTIONS=true
   SHOW_STORAGE_RECOMMENDATIONS=true
   DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS=STANDARD
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check your cost optimization:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:5000/api/storage/cost-analysis
   ```

**That's it!** Your files will now be automatically stored in the most cost-effective S3 storage classes.

## New contributors setup

To ensure a smooth onboarding experience and consistent Git behavior across platforms:

- Windows users: this repo enforces LF line endings via `.gitattributes`. Configure Git to keep LF on commit:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  ```
  If you cloned the repo before this change and you see line-ending warnings, normalize your working tree once:
  ```bash
  git add --renormalize .
  git commit -m "Normalize line endings to LF"
  ```
- macOS/Linux users: no action needed; LF is the default.

Environment variables are provided in `env.example`. Copy it to `.env` and update the values before running locally.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd skycrate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` file with your AWS credentials:
   ```env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key_here
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the backend server (port 5000) and frontend (port 3000).


## üéØ Storage Class Selection Configuration

Configure how users interact with AWS S3 storage classes:

```env
# Enable storage class selection modal for users
SHOW_STORAGE_CLASS_OPTIONS=true

# Show smart recommendations based on file type/size
SHOW_STORAGE_RECOMMENDATIONS=true

# Default storage class if user doesn't choose
DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS=STANDARD

# Recommendation thresholds and file types
RECOMMEND_STANDARD_IA_THRESHOLD_MB=100
RECOMMEND_GLACIER_EXTENSIONS=.zip,.rar,.tar,.gz,.7z,.bz2
RECOMMEND_GLACIER_IR_EXTENSIONS=.bak,.backup,.sql,.dump
RECOMMEND_STANDARD_EXTENSIONS=.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.gif,.mp4,.avi,.pdf,.doc,.docx
```

### Configuration Options:

- **`SHOW_STORAGE_CLASS_OPTIONS`**: Set to `true` to show storage class selection modal
- **`SHOW_STORAGE_RECOMMENDATIONS`**: Set to `true` to display smart recommendations
- **`DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS`**: Fallback storage class (STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, etc.)
- **Recommendation Rules**: Customize which file types get which recommendations

### User Experience:

- **Single file upload**: Shows storage class selection modal with recommendations
- **Multiple file upload**: Uses default storage class for smooth UX
- **Cost transparency**: Users see estimated monthly costs for each option
- **Smart suggestions**: Recommendations based on file type, size, and usage patterns

## AWS Setup (Optional - PAID)

Only needed if you choose `STORAGE_MODE=aws`. See [`COST_EFFECTIVE_STORAGE.md`](./COST_EFFECTIVE_STORAGE.md) for AWS setup details.

## üéØ Migration Guide

**From AWS S3 to FREE storage:**
1. Backup your S3 data
2. Change `STORAGE_MODE=local` and `USE_NEW_STORAGE=true`
3. Restart application
4. Re-upload files (now stored locally for FREE!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this.
