# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a monochromatic theme system for the SkyCrate dashboard, converting the existing blue and orange color scheme to a sophisticated black and white design. The theme will maintain all existing functionality while providing a clean, professional aesthetic inspired by modern dashboard designs. The implementation will focus on subtle contrasts, elegant typography, and refined visual hierarchy using only grayscale colors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a monochromatic theme option that converts the dashboard to black and white colors, so that I can have a clean, professional interface that reduces visual distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monochromatic theme is applied THEN the system SHALL replace all blue primary colors with black (#000000)
2. WHEN the monochromatic theme is applied THEN the system SHALL replace all orange accent colors with white (#FFFFFF)
3. WHEN the monochromatic theme is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
4. WHEN the monochromatic theme is applied THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN the monochromatic theme is applied THEN the system SHALL use subtle gray variations for different UI elements and states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the monochromatic theme to provide clear visual hierarchy and element distinction, so that I can easily navigate and interact with the dashboard despite the limited color palette.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the monochromatic theme THEN the system SHALL use different shades of gray (ranging from #F8F9FA to #212529) for background variations
2. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback using opacity changes and shadow effects
3. WHEN elements are in focus or active states THEN the system SHALL use high contrast black/white combinations for clear indication
4. WHEN displaying cards and containers THEN the system SHALL use subtle borders and shadows to maintain visual separation
5. WHEN showing different content sections THEN the system SHALL use varying background shades to create clear content grouping

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the monochromatic theme to be automatically applied as the default theme, so that I get the clean aesthetic immediately without needing to manually switch themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply the monochromatic theme by default
2. WHEN the theme toggle is used THEN the system SHALL switch between monochromatic and the original colored theme
3. WHEN the theme preference is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the selection in localStorage
4. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's last selected theme preference
5. WHEN the system detects user's OS theme preference THEN the system SHALL respect it for the initial theme selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all dashboard components (sidebar, main content, modals, forms) to be consistently styled with the monochromatic theme, so that I have a cohesive visual experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the sidebar THEN the system SHALL display it with black background and white text with subtle gray hover states
2. WHEN viewing the main content area THEN the system SHALL use white/light gray backgrounds with black text
3. WHEN viewing file cards and items THEN the system SHALL use white backgrounds with black text and subtle gray borders
4. WHEN viewing modals and overlays THEN the system SHALL use appropriate black/white/gray combinations for proper contrast
5. WHEN viewing form elements THEN the system SHALL use black borders and white backgrounds with proper focus states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the monochromatic theme to enhance the dashboard's modern appearance while keeping it clean and minimal, so that I can focus on my content without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL eliminate all color gradients in favor of solid colors or subtle gray gradients
2. WHEN viewing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use clean, sharp borders instead of colored highlights
3. WHEN viewing icons and graphics THEN the system SHALL render them in appropriate black, white, or gray tones
4. WHEN viewing status indicators THEN the system SHALL use different shades of gray and text labels instead of colors
5. WHEN viewing the overall layout THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing spacing and typography while applying the monochromatic color scheme
