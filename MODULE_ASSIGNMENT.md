- **Performance optimization** and user experience improvements
- **Focus**: Innovation, design, and user-facing improvements

## Development Guidelines

### For All Modules:
1. Maintain existing code quality and testing standards
2. Follow the established project architecture
3. Ensure proper error handling and security
4. Update documentation as changes are made
5. Coordinate with other module owners for integration points

### For Person 5 (Storage Optimization & Versioning):
